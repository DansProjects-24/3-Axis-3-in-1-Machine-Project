# 3-Axis 3-in-1 Machine Project
Design Files for the 3-in-1 Mill/ 3D printer/ Laser Engraver developed as part of my 2021 dissertation for my Mechanical Engineering Degree.

The aim is to develop a design which incorporates the key features necessary for the three manufacturing processes: 3D printing, laser cutting, and milling, into a single machine with a modular approach to the toolhead for minimal reconfiguration time. The machine is designed to be built using 3D printed components and standard engineering hardware.

See the Build Guide [link] for details how to build it and what components are needed.
